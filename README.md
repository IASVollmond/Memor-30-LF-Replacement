# Memor 12/30 LF CR Replacement

## Description

The project is a VisualFormatter that converts CR or LF into a comma on Datalogic Memor 12/30 devices. This allows barcodes containing, for example, multiple serial numbers to be separated by commas, making them easier to process.

## Installation
1. Open the **Scan2Depoly** App
2. Scan the Barocde from the **.pdf** File
 
That's it.
